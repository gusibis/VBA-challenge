# VBA-challenge
2nd Module-VBA
Added conditional formatting to column "Percent Change" as it was in the instructions.
On Friday 02/25/2023 added checkboxes to remove conditional formatting from the "Yearly Change" and "Percent Change" columns. This challenge instructions first say to match our results to the picture shown that only has conditional formatting for the "Yearly Change" column, but then says the "Percent Change" column must have conditional formatting as well, which would make it not match the picture. Added the option to remove conditional formatting from these columns for this reason.
